# Wristwatch-For-Alzheimer-Patient
Alzheimer's disease presents significant challenges for both patients and caregivers, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance patient safety and quality of life.
One such solution is the development of a wristwatch specifically designed for Alzheimer's patients.

The proposed wristwatch integrates various features to address common challenges faced by Alzheimer's patients, including memory loss, disorientation, and difficulty with time management.
This device helps in tracking patient's location through gps and sends location to caretaker. It also helps the patient to remember their family members and displays contact information of caretakers.
